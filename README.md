# AI-Powered Public Complaint and RTI Generator

## Overview
The AI-Powered Public Complaint and RTI Generator is an open-source project designed to help citizens easily draft public complaints and RTI (Right to Information) applications.

Many people face difficulties in understanding the correct format, legal language, and structure required for complaints and RTIs. This project aims to reduce these challenges by providing AI-assisted draft generation that is clear, structured, and easy to edit.

The project is intended to be simple, transparent, and beginner-friendly, both for users and contributors.

## Motivation
Interacting with public institutions often requires:
- Correct formatting of complaints and RTI applications
- Clear and formal language
- Awareness of basic legal structure

For many citizens, especially first-time users, this becomes a barrier. This project focuses on lowering that barrier using open-source tools and AI assistance, while keeping the user fully in control of the final content.

## Project Goals
- Simplify the process of drafting public complaints and RTI applications
- Provide structured and easy-to-understand drafts
- Support multiple languages (starting with English and Hindi)
- Encourage open-source contributions from beginners
- Build a sustainable and transparent civic-tech tool

## Current Status
The project is in an early development stage.

At present, the repository focuses on:
- Project structure
- Documentation
- Defining clear contribution workflows
- Laying the foundation for future development

Core functionality will be developed incrementally through open collaboration.
